# WinterCMS Vite Watch and Live Reload on WSL
This is the template I use for local development using vite in WinterCMS. Tested with VSCode on Windows 11 using Ubuntu in WSL.

The file is based of the config file generated with theme generator provided in WinterCMS using command: 
`php artisan create:theme theme-name`. 

Addintional fields have been added to enable for watching files and having the browser live reload while using vite:watch during development.
`php artisan vite:watch theme-name`
